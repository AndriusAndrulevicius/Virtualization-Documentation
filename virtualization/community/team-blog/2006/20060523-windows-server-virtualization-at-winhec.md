# Windows Server virtualization at WinHEC

Hello and welcome to the Microsoft virtual machine team’s blog! On Monday the 22nd, as part of the WinHEC conference, we [announced](http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2006/may06/05-22Virtualization.mspx) the next steps in our virtualization strategy and outlined our roadmap of products. As we march towards release, we are starting a team blog to discuss machine virtualization plans at Microsoft in more detail. As the Product Unit Manager for the team, I’ve been asked to provide the first post for the team and kick off the blog. Welcome!
